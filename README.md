# Samuel-Portfolio

This is a static website that I created the projects I have worked on as well as some of my skills as well

For the creation of this website, I used HTML, CSS for the styling and to make it responsive, also 
JavaScript to add the functionality to the contact form, so that the contact form sends the detalis such as the visitor's 
name, email and message they want to a google sheets page that is connected to the website. 

This is the link to the website : ( https://samuelteklemariam.github.io/Samuel-Portfolio/ )
